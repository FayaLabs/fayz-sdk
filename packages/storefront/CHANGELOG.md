# @fayz-ai/storefront

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 9c83f41: Commerce moves onto the core spine, and the migration chain becomes replay-safe.

  **Spine:**

  - `@fayz-ai/db`: `public.addresses` becomes a spine table (`017_core_addresses.sql`). It shipped inside `@fayz-ai/shop` until now, so every non-shop vertical rendered "Could not find the table 'public.addresses'" on the person archetype's addresses tab. Additive and replay-safe on pools that already have it.
  - `@fayz-ai/shop`: orders, customers and categories become core records (`people` · `orders` · `order_items` · `categories`), expand-phase only — ids preserved, nothing dropped, a trigger keeps the two in step.
  - `@fayz-ai/shop`: placing an order raises a real receivable and the parallel ledger is retired. `public.transactions` keeps its rows and stays the generic archetype table other verticals use; the shop stops being one of its writers, and settled history was migrated across.

  **Fixes (retro-compatibility on already-provisioned pools):**

  - `@fayz-ai/shop` 0024: the paid-history snapshot was a `CREATE TEMP TABLE ... ON COMMIT DROP` executed outside a transaction block, so it was destroyed by its own commit and the historical receipt backfill never ran.
  - `@fayz-ai/shop` 0021: `shop_quote_shipping` is dropped before creation — 0022 widens its OUT columns, and `CREATE OR REPLACE` cannot change a row type, so replaying 0021 on a pool that had reached 0022 was a hard error.
  - `@fayz-ai/shop` 0019: the replacement `storefront_public_read` policies had no `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` of their own.
  - `@fayz-ai/plugin-crm`: `006_lead_enters_pipeline.sql` existed on disk but was never embedded into `MIGRATIONS`, so it could not be applied at all.
  - `@fayz-ai/plugin-crm`: `updateLead` replaced `people.metadata` wholesale, erasing the public form's answers (`formId`/`fields`/`utm`) whenever a lead's status was edited — the third call site of the bug the pipeline drag fix addressed.
  - `packages/shop/test/run-migrations.sh`: a failing migration was swallowed by `cmd && echo ok` (not a `set -e` context), so the bench graded a half-provisioned database and still printed "all regressions passed". It now aborts on apply failure, applies 0025, and replays the whole chain twice to assert convergence.

  **Features:**

  - `@fayz-ai/core`: postal-code helpers + pluggable lookup provider (`lookupPostalCode`, `createViaCepProvider`).
  - `@fayz-ai/saas`: the addresses archetype tab becomes editable (create/edit/delete, default handling); `FieldDef.hint` is carried into the agent contract, and spine tables whose surface is a detail tab are projected into it.
  - `@fayz-ai/storefront`: delivery estimation, product gallery, server-derived shipping.
  - `@fayz-ai/plugin-inventory`: `modules.products` opt-out for hosts that register products elsewhere (defaults on — existing apps are unaffected).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c88dd5c: Foundation cleanup + mobile/B2C wave + auth extraction.

  **Breaking (0.x minor):**

  - `@fayz-ai/saas`: `createSaasApp` / `SaasAppConfig` / `PageConfig` / `createFayzApp` removed — the only entry is `defineSaas(FayzAppConfig)` + `renderApp`. Settings tabs single-sourced in AdminShell.
  - `@fayz-ai/core`: removed conflicting duplicate `SaasTheme`/`ThemeConfig` types (use `@fayz-ai/saas`), removed unused `PluginServerAction`/`PluginCustomFieldsDef`/`marketplace` manifest fields, `createFayzApiProvider` moved to `data/platform-api` (public export unchanged).
  - `@fayz-ai/storefront`: `slot-contracts` replaced by `component-contracts` + `component-selectors`; new `define.*` config entry; new section components (MediaCarousel, ProductSlider, SmoothImage, ProductEnquiryForm).

  **Features:**

  - New `DashboardSurface` `'finance-home'` — B2C consumer-finance home widgets are scoped to it and never leak onto the B2B `'home'` dashboard.
  - `plugin-financial`: opt-in `quickAdd` option (header buttons default OFF); Mobills-grade responsive quick-add/cards/receipt views; native home dashboard widgets.
  - `plugin-agenda`: `eventMode: 'simple'` (Google-Calendar-style events) + Lista view.
  - `@fayz-ai/saas`: mobile bottom tab bar + center action, transparent mobile header, brand sidebar derivation, explicit `__kind` theme discriminator with centralized `isSaasTheme()`.
  - `@fayz-ai/auth`: adapter contract extended (resetPassword redirectTo, updatePassword, handleCallback); auth pages/forms extracted into the new `@fayz-ai/plugin-auth` package (first release, consumed by saas).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Re-align the whole SDK suite onto a single version line (0.5.0). The linked group had drifted across separate release runs (sdk 0.2.0 … storefront 0.4.0); this bumps every suite package together so "the SDK" has one coherent version. `@fayz-ai/portal` and `@fayz-ai/courses` are added to the linked group. No behavioural changes — version hygiene only.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Front-door facades for storefront + member apps, mirroring `@fayz-ai/saas`.

  - `@fayz-ai/storefront` now re-exports `renderApp`/`getSupabaseClientOptional` from `@fayz-ai/core` and adds subpaths `@fayz-ai/storefront/ui` (→ `@fayz-ai/ui`), `@fayz-ai/storefront/catalog` (→ `@fayz-ai/shop/catalog`) and `@fayz-ai/storefront/shop` (→ `@fayz-ai/sdk/shop`). Adds `@fayz-ai/sdk` as a dependency. Storefront apps can now depend on `@fayz-ai/storefront` alone.
  - `@fayz-ai/portal` is now published (was private) and re-exports `renderApp`/`defineApp` from `@fayz-ai/core` plus the courses provider API (`setCoursesProvider`, `createMockCoursesProvider`, `useMyCourses`, …) from `@fayz-ai/courses`. Member apps can depend on `@fayz-ai/portal` alone.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bd8e8cd: Lock SDK/plugin architecture boundaries (FAY-1217).

  - Bless the multi-package public surface: packages that generated apps already
    depend on (`storefront`, `shop`, `courses`, and the `plugin-menu` / `-orders` /
    `-tables` / `-sites` / `-shop` / `-reputation` / `-courses` / `-conversations` /
    `-automations` plugins) are now published instead of `private`, fixing apps that
    depended on unpublishable packages.
  - Add `@fayz-ai/sdk/supported-surface` (+ `supported-surface.json`): the
    machine-readable list of packages an app may depend on, with `isSupportedPackage`,
    `getSupportedPackages`, `getInternalPackages` helpers — the contract `fayz doctor`
    checks against.
  - Add `@fayz-ai/sdk/ai-builder`: the AI Builder request taxonomy contract
    (`AI_BUILDER_REQUEST_CLASSES`, `isAllowedRequestClass`) mapping request classes to
    the architecture layer each may touch — the contract the platform classifier targets.
  - Reserve three `PluginManifest` extension seams (`serverActions`, `customFields`,
    `diagnostics`) on `@fayz-ai/core` — contract shape locked, implementation lazy.
  - Point manifest/plugin version-mismatch errors at `@fayz-ai/core` (the package that
    carries the runtime) instead of the deprecated `@fayz-ai/app-runtime` umbrella.
  - Fix plugin-crm typecheck: declare the missing `@fayz-ai/db` + `drizzle-orm`
    devDependencies its drizzle schema needs, so repo-wide typecheck/build is green.
