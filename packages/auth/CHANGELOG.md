# @fayz-ai/auth

## 0.6.0

### Patch Changes

- @fayz-ai/core@0.6.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Re-align the whole SDK suite onto a single version line (0.5.0). The linked group had drifted across separate release runs (sdk 0.2.0 … storefront 0.4.0); this bumps every suite package together so "the SDK" has one coherent version. `@fayz-ai/portal` and `@fayz-ai/courses` are added to the linked group. No behavioural changes — version hygiene only.

### Patch Changes

## 0.2.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bd8e8cd]
  - @fayz-ai/core@0.2.0

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Ship package READMEs to npm. Republish the SaaS foundation packages so their
  npm pages render the new story-driven READMEs (npm only shows a README for a
  freshly published version). No code changes — docs only.
- Updated dependencies
  - @fayz-ai/core@0.1.7

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 413842d: Publish the SaaS app foundation to public npm: core, auth, ui, saas, db, and the
  agenda, financial, inventory, crm, dashboard, marketing, forms, and tasks plugins.
  This unblocks client repos (and the Fayz generator) installing the full plugin set
  as normal npm dependencies instead of via local source links.

  - @fayz-ai/core@0.1.6
