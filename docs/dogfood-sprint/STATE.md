# STATE — live ledger (read first, every iteration)

> The brain. Trust this over chat history. Update it at the end of every iteration.

## FOCUS
- **App:** beauty-saas
- **Next task:** B4 (author idempotent migrations for the views/columns B2/B5 need)
- **Milestone in progress:** M-BEAUTY

## Order
beauty-saas → pulse-store → resto-saas → agency-os  (edit to reorder)

## Task queues  (mirror of PLAN.md — tick here as you go)

### beauty-saas  [M-BEAUTY]
- [x] B2 dashboard real queries — 7/10 metrics wired (v_bookings/v_clients/v_staff); avg-rating, occupancy, product-sales left hardcoded w/ TODO(B4) — typecheck pass
- [x] B3 onboarding real checks — 4/4 wired via tableHasRows() existence helper (clients→v_clients; services→saas_core.services; schedule→saas_core.schedules; payments→public.payment_methods). countRows `schema` param used for cross-schema; try/catch → false on missing source. No new view needed. typecheck pass
- [ ] B4 migrations for B2/B3 views
- [ ] B5 commission compute
- [ ] B6 public booking flow
- [ ] B7 plugins on real data + tenant wiring
- [~] B-CHECK human: apply migrations + login smoke test

### pulse-store  [M-PULSE]
- [ ] P1 catalog→shop_products seed module
- [ ] P2 storefront content from data
- [~] P3 human: seed live + place test order (RLS verify)

### resto-saas  [M-RESTO]
- [ ] R1 real provider selection + env
- [ ] R2 MenuManager real data
- [ ] R3 app-owned restaurant module/plugin seam (community-plugin template)
- [ ] R4 orders/tables real data + RLS
- [~] R-CHECK human: provision DB, apply migrations, smoke test

### agency-os  [M-AGENCY]
- [ ] A1 initial migration set (saas_core + agency Ring-2)
- [ ] A2 replace placeholders, wire conversations/CRM/calendars
- [ ] A3 multi-org isolation
- [~] A-CHECK human: apply migrations, smoke test

## Blockers
- (none yet)

## Notes for B4 (migrations)
- B2 left 3 metrics hardcoded — each needs a source view before it can be real:
  - `avg-rating` → reviews/ratings table or `v_client_ratings` (none exists).
  - `occupancy-rate` → slot-capacity view from `work_schedules` × service duration.
  - `product-sales` → goods-vs-service split on order lines or an `inv_` sales rollup.
- B2 revenue uses `v_bookings.order_total` summed client-side via `listRows` (no
  server aggregate in `fayz.data`). If volume grows, B4 can add `v_revenue_week`.
- B3 needs **no new view**: `fayz.data.countRows` accepts a `schema` param, so
  services/schedules are counted directly against `saas_core.*` (same access path
  the archetype-lookup uses). The v_* views are only for cross-schema JOINs.
- B5 (commission) needs `staff_members.commission_rate` — confirm/add the column.

## FOR THE HUMAN  (checkpoint queue — do these when you stop in)
- Nothing staged yet. The first checkpoint will be **B-CHECK** once beauty-saas code tasks land.

## FEEDBACK  (you write here; the next iteration honors it first)
