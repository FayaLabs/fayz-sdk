# DATA-MODEL — rings, migrations, RLS, and the Supabase topology

Status: canonical · Updated: 2026-07-06
Owner-of-truth: `packages/db/src/schema/spine.ts` + `scripts/check-plugin-capability.mjs` (RLS lock) + design RFCs `design/MIGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md` / `design/PLUGIN-MIGRATIONS.md`

The data architecture in one sentence: **a small fixed spine of universal archetypes, plugin-owned prefixed tables around it, app-owned 1:1 extensions on top — every row tenant-scoped, every schema change delivered as a plugin migration.** This document is the canon; the two RFCs in `design/` hold the rationale and remain the deep reference.

> **Industry-pool update (2026-07).** The spine no longer lives in a dedicated `saas_core`
> schema — the industry-pool model provisions core **directly in `public`** (tables
> `public.people`, `public.orders`, `public.appointments`, …; tenant helper
> `public.user_tenant_ids()`), with plugin tables prefixed `plg_<plugin>_*` also in
> `public`. References to `saas_core.*` below and in the `design/` RFCs describe the earlier
> schema-qualified design; read them as `public.*`. The end-to-end packaging rules live in
> [PLUGIN-CONTRACT.md](./PLUGIN-CONTRACT.md).

## 1. The three rings

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph R0["Ring 0 — saas_core.* (shared spine, FIXED)"]
        direction LR
        SPINE["tenants · profiles · tenant_members\n+ public.user_tenant_ids()"]
        ARCH["5 archetypes:\npersons · products (kind: good|service)\nlocations · bookings"]
    end
    subgraph R1["Ring 1 — plugin-owned capability tables"]
        direction LR
        T1["tsk_* (tasks)"]
        T2["crm_* (crm)"]
        T3["fin_* (financial)"]
        T4["inv_* (inventory)"]
        T5["shop_* (shop)"]
    end
    subgraph R2["Ring 2 — public.* app extensions (1:1 by id)"]
        direction LR
        E1["clients (person_id PK)"]
        E2["staff_members (person_id PK)"]
        E3["appointments (booking_id PK)"]
    end
    V["public.v_* bridge views (security_invoker)"]

    R1 -- "FK to spine ids ONLY" --> R0
    R2 -- "PK = archetype id" --> R0
    V --- R0
    V --- R2
```

| Ring | Owner | Contents | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** `saas_core.*` | Fayz, fixed | spine + the 5 archetypes | small and universal — **apps never add to it**; domain detail here would turn the core into a giant CRM |
| **1** `<prefix>_*` | each plugin | capability tables under the plugin's prefix | prefix = ownership + isolation boundary; provisioned by `manifest.migrations[]`; never redefines an archetype |
| **2** `public.*` extensions | the app | 1:1 id-shared extension tables + app-specific tables | may add columns and tables, must carry `tenant_id` + RLS; never a parallel entity |

### The five archetypes

Every business app is built from five nouns — this is the whole core vocabulary:

| Archetype | Table | Kind discriminator | Examples across apps |
|---|---|---|---|
| person | `saas_core.persons` | `customer` · `staff` · `lead` · `vendor` | client, professional, shopper |
| product | `saas_core.products` | `good` · `service` | SKU, menu item, course |
| service | (product, `kind='service'`) | — | haircut, retainer — a 6th table was deliberately rejected; unified pricing/catalog logic |
| location | `saas_core.locations` | `branch` · `room` · `zone` | salon unit, restaurant area |
| booking | `saas_core.bookings` | `appointment` · `reservation` · `order` | appointment, table reservation |

`kind` instead of new tables means one identity model, one search, one CRUD engine, one RLS set — and `createArchetypeLookup` routes UI by (archetype, kind). The beautyplace audit (112 production tables) mapped onto the rings with **zero changes to Ring 0** — the strongest evidence the vocabulary is right (full mapping preserved in `archive/data-model-2026-06.md`).

In code, the spine is declared **references-only**: `packages/db/src/schema/spine.ts` exposes `pgSchema('saas_core')` tables with just `id uuid PK` so plugin FKs typecheck; live columns are authoritative and never re-created. Plugin schemas import builders from `@fayz-ai/db` (`pgTable`, `tenantId()`, `timestamps`, `createdAt`, spine refs) — **never `drizzle-orm/pg-core` directly** (single drizzle instance rule).

## 2. Bridge views and the archetype provider

PostgREST cannot join across schemas, so cross-schema reads go through `public.v_*` views (`security_invoker = true`, so RLS still applies): each plugin/app ships views that JOIN its extension tables to the archetypes (`v_clients`, `v_staff`, `v_leads`, `v_deals`, `v_bookings`…). Naming: `v_{table}`, with the overrides map in the archetype provider.

**Report views** (the read-only aggregates consumed by `@fayz-ai/plugin-reports`) are plugin-owned, so they carry the Ring 1 prefix plus a `rep_` marker: `plg_<plugin>_rep_<métrica>` (e.g. `plg_courses_rep_revenue`). Same rules as `v_*` — `security_invoker = true`, `GRANT SELECT` to `authenticated`.

`createArchetypeProvider` (`packages/core/src/data/archetype.ts`) is the standard read/write path for archetype-backed entities: it splits writes into archetype columns (→ `saas_core.<base>`) vs project columns (→ the extension table keyed by `<fk>_id`), reads from the `v_` view (or straight from `saas_core.<base>` for pure-archetype entities where `projectTable === base`), and maps camelCase↔snake_case. Query the views, not the raw tables — reports read canonical views only (§6 invariant 4).

## 3. RLS — locked and CI-enforced

**One canonical predicate** on every tenant-scoped table:

```sql
CREATE POLICY ... USING (tenant_id IN (SELECT public.user_tenant_ids()))
```

This is **M-LOCK / L4** — not a convention, a gate. `scripts/check-plugin-capability.mjs` audits every plugin's migrations and classifies the isolation form; under `--strict`, `divergent` / `no-rls` / `other` **fail CI**. Two forms pass:

- **canonical** — the policy text inline in the plugin's migrations (plugin-tasks, plugin-forms).
- **deferred** — plugin ships `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` without `CREATE POLICY`; the app's `project_rls.sql` auto-detect DO-block emits exactly the canonical policy at apply time for every `public` base table with a `tenant_id` column (crm, financial, inventory). Deferred lands as canonical on a real DB — a deferral of *where the text lives*, not a divergence. Generation prefers explicit canonical.

State at lock: 2 canonical · 3 deferred · 0 divergent · 0 no-rls. What RLS *presence* doesn't prove — correctness against fixtures — is [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) §3's job.

## 4. Cross-plugin data: links, not foreign keys

**Position (locked):** tables in one plugin's prefix **never FK-reference another plugin's prefix.** The only FKs that cross an ownership boundary point at Ring 0 spine ids. When two plugins' data must relate (a `fin_` commission references an agenda booking), the relation goes through the archetype spine (`saas_core.bookings.id`) or a link table owned by whichever plugin declares the relationship — resolved at query time, Medusa's `defineLink` discipline ([BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) §4).

```mermaid
erDiagram
    saas_core_bookings ||--o{ fin_commissions : "spine id (allowed)"
    saas_core_persons ||--o{ crm_lead_activities : "spine id (allowed)"
    fin_commissions }o--|| crm_deals : "FORBIDDEN - no cross-prefix FK"
```

Why: independent install/uninstall. A tenant disabling plugin-crm must not orphan or break plugin-financial's constraints — WordPress-style plugin-interaction breakage starts with entangled schemas ([BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) §1.2, §3-Odoo). `[decision-needed]`: whether to formalize a `defineLink`-style primitive in `@fayz-ai/db` or keep convention + a doctor check that scans for cross-prefix FKs — queued in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) Appendix B.

## 5. Migrations

**Position (locked):** a plugin's schema ships as **`manifest.migrations[]`** — `PluginMigration { id, version, sql, description }`, versioned SQL strings, inspectable as data. Loose `.sql` files in a plugin's tree that are not wired into the manifest are a **contract violation**: they make the plugin lie about what installing it provisions.

Current state — the split-brain this position remediates:

| Plugin | `.sql` files | Wired into manifest | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| plugin-tasks | ✅ | ✅ | the reference (FAY-1206) |
| plugin-crm | 4 | ❌ | `[partial]` — delivered via app-side companion SQL |
| plugin-financial | 9 | ❌ | `[partial]` |
| plugin-inventory | 3 | ❌ | `[partial]` |
| plugin-forms | 2 | ❌ | `[partial]` |
| plugin-agenda | none shipped | — | worst standing violation (DECISIONS 2026-06-17) `[planned FAY-1252]` |
| 13 others | none | — | UI-only/bridge plugins — nothing to ship yet |

Remediation is Phase-1 work: wire the loose SQL into manifests (FAY-1211 audit → FAY-1252), and land the **install-time migration runner** (`[planned FAY-1205]`) that applies `manifest.migrations[]` on plugin enable:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Builder / Panel
    participant R as Install runner [planned FAY-1205]
    participant M as manifest.migrations[]
    participant DB as Supabase project
    participant D as fayz doctor

    B->>R: enable plugin(s)
    R->>M: collect across enabled plugins
    R->>R: order (plugin dependency order, then version)
    R->>DB: apply pending (recorded in migrations ledger)
    R->>DB: seed registries[].seedData
    B->>D: verify diagnostics[].requires (rpcs/views/tables/env)
    D-->>B: boot report — green or actionable failures
```

Rules that survive any runner design:

- **Append-only once applied.** A migration that has touched any real database is immutable — fix forward with a new migration. Before first apply, edit in place (a fresh apply should yield the final shape, not base-then-patch).
- **Idempotent SQL** — DO-block guards, `IF NOT EXISTS`; plugins may be enabled into existing databases.
- **RLS canon** (§3) in every table-creating migration, or sanctioned deferral.
- **Odoo-style pre/post phasing** around schema apply for data fixups `[planned]`; **Payload-style diff-generated migrations** for AI-authored plugins is a far-horizon option `[decision-needed]` ([BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) §4).
- App-level (Ring 2) migrations live in the app's `supabase/migrations/` per `design/MIGRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 6. The order-to-cash spine (in progress)

The shared commercial model the financial/agenda/crm plugins converge on — ported from the refactor plan (S1–S6, additive-then-flip; status: in flight, verify against Linear):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph SALES["Sales (CRM)"]
    Q[order kind=quote/deal<br/>+ deal_extensions]
  end
  subgraph COMMERCE["Commercial document"]
    O[order<br/>party, totals, terms]
    OI[order_items<br/>the ONLY line items]
    O --> OI
  end
  subgraph OPS["Operational (Agenda)"]
    B[booking<br/>time, professional, room]
  end
  subgraph FIN["Financial"]
    INV[invoice = order in financial role]
    MOV[(financial_movements<br/>APPEND-ONLY ledger)]
    BAL[/"v_invoice_balances = SUM(movements)"/]
    INV --> MOV --> BAL
  end
  Q -- promote --> O
  B -- N:1 --> O
  O -- becomes / links --> INV
  COMMERCE -. canonical views .-> R[(v_revenue · v_receivables · v_appointments)]
  FIN -. canonical views .-> R
```

The five invariants: **one writer per fact** (operational status only on `bookings`; financial status derived); **money is event-sourced** (`financial_movements` append-only; balances are views, never stored); **cross-document transitions are transactional DB functions** (`fn_invoice_from_order`, `fn_pay_invoice`) that plugins call, never re-implement; **reports read canonical views only**; **lifecycle is constrained** (kind→status matrix).

## 7. Supabase project topology — the standard

**Position (locked; de-facto proven by the dogfoods, now written down):** two tiers.

| Tier | Model | Used by | Isolation | When to choose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shared product project** | one Supabase project per *product*, many stores/tenants inside, discriminated by id | **FayzShop** (shopfront/pulse/tannat/cristina via `PUBLIC_FAYZ_STORE_ID`), **FayzCourse** (course-admin + course-members) | row-level (`store_id` / `tenant_id` + RLS) | high-volume, low-variance product instances (shops, course sites) where per-instance projects don't pay |
| **Dedicated project** | one Supabase project per SaaS app | beauty-saas, agency-os, norman-ai (staged), resto-saas | project-level (plus RLS inside for multi-tenant SaaS) | a real business's operating system: independent backup/restore, quota, and blast radius; the "your Supabase" exit story |

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph shared["Shared product projects"]
        FS[("FayzShop")]
        FC[("FayzCourse")]
    end
    subgraph dedicated["Dedicated projects"]
        BS[("beauty-saas")]
        AG[("agency-os")]
        NM[("norman-ai · staged")]
    end
    S1[shopfront] & S2[pulse] & S3[tannat] & S4[cristina] -- store_id --> FS
    CA[course-admin] & CM[course-members] --> FC
    B[BeautySoft app] --> BS
    A[agency app] --> AG
    N[norman PWA] --> NM
```

Decision rules for the builder ([AI-BUILDER.md](AI-BUILDER.md) §8): a *product instance* (another shop, another course site) lands in the shared project of that product; a *SaaS for a real business* gets a dedicated project. Either way the schema is the same three rings; the tiers differ only in project boundary. What this standard deliberately keeps simple: no per-domain project federation (resto's commented `VITE_FAYZ_MENU_PROJECT_ID` vars are an unadopted idea, not a direction). Provisioning automation, cost model, and project *ownership* (fayz org vs customer org) are open operational questions — [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) §3 and Appendix B.

## 8. Seeds and mocks

Two data tiers a plugin declares, both in the manifest: `registries[].seedData` (real reference rows provisioned at install) and `registries[].mockData` (walkable demo data). `createSafeDataProvider` gives every plugin the standard supabase-or-mock fallback so **every app ships walkable in mock mode** — the course platform's M1-mock → M2-live launch sequence (FAY-1257) is the canonical use.

## 9. Live-DB protocol (standing rule)

Lifted from DECISIONS — binding for humans and agents: **inventory + destructive-scan first; report before any destructive step; apply only additive/idempotent files.** Known landmine: `plugin-forms/002` re-runs destructively (drops `frm_documents`) — never run a full pipeline against a live DB without a skip-ledger.
